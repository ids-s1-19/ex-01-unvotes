Let's take a look at the voting history of countries in the United Nations 
General Assembly. We will be using data from the __unvotes__ package. 
Additionally, we will make use of the __tidyverse__ and __lubridate__ packages 
for the analysis, and the __DT__ package for interactive display of tabular 
output.

```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(unvotes)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DT)
```

The unvotes package provides three datasets we can work with: 

1. `un_roll_calls`: Each roll call vote of the United Nations General Assembly
2. `un_roll_call_issues`: Topic classifications of roll call votes of the United Nations General Assembly
3. `un_votes`: Information on the voting history of the United Nations General Assembly

Each of these datasets contains a variable called `rcid` (roll call id) which 
can be used as a unique identifier to join them with each other.

Let's  create a data visualization that displays how the voting record of the 
UK & NI changed over time on a variety of issues, and compares it to two other 
countries: US and Turkey.

```{r plot-yearly-yes-issue, fig.width=10, warning=FALSE}
un_votes %>%
  mutate(country =
           case_when(
             country == "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" ~ "UK & NI",
             country == "United States of America"                             ~ "US",
             TRUE                                                              ~ country
             )) %>%
  dplyr::filter(country %in% c("UK & NI", "US", "Turkey")) %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid") %>%
  group_by(country, year = year(date), issue) %>%
  summarize(
    votes = n(),
    percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")
    ) %>%
  dplyr::filter(votes > 5) %>%  # only use records where there are more than 5 votes
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~ issue) +
    labs(
      title = "Percentage of 'Yes' votes in the UN General Assembly",
      subtitle = "1946 to 2015",
      y = "% Yes",
      x = "Year",
      color = "Country"
    )
```

We can easily change which countries are being plotted by changing which 
countries the code above `filter`s for. Note that the country name should be 
spelled and capitalized exactly the same way as it appears in the data. See 
the [Appendix](#appendix) for a list of the countries in the data.
